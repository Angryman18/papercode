# About Papercode
Hi. This is Shyam Mahnata. I have created PaperCode which is a simeple online coding playground app which offers live coding on a web based IDE in multiple languages like javascript, typescript, python, c++ and also run or exeucute them in their browser for the output.

If you donot understand what is a live coding playground then simply its like replit.com with very very minimal features and options.

In order to save the code and come back later PaperCode has authentication system for the user to sign in and save their code and comeback later to continue but remember signing in is not mandatory in order to create a paper

It also has some basic operation like showing notifications, editing papername, deleting them saving them etc.

For instance people can just create a paper and start coding on it without signing in but after authentication it has sync system which autometically creates the paper at the backend and offers simultineous coding experience whichout any issue.

Popular Librery like Material UI, Redux Toolkit are used in order the handle the UI and state management.

# NHOST
Paper is powered by nhost.io. A short introduction for the NHOST is a firebase aleternative which has multiple services like authentication, graphql out of box, managing sql database using hasura, serverless functions etc and for this project few of the nhost services are used like authentication (using google and github), database, graphql query, user roles etc.
